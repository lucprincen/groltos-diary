# The Professor

A magical talking orb, previously belonging to [[Nass Lantomir]] and [[Vellynne Harpell]]. It contains knowledge on a number of topics:

1.  The history of Netheril and how to create a mythallar
2.  Vampirism and the traits of vampires 
3.  Rituals surrounding the making, bottling, and drinking of Elverquisst 
4.  The tarrasque

It is now back in the possession of [[Vellynne Harpell]] as it was purportedly "borrowed" by [[Nass Lantomir]].
